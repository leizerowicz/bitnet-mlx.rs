CREATE SCHEMA tenant_management;
CREATE SCHEMA billing_system;
CREATE SCHEMA usage_tracking;
CREATE SCHEMA audit_logs;

-- Tenant isolation with row-level security
CREATE TABLE tenants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    tier VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    settings JSONB
);

-- Usage metering for billing
CREATE TABLE api_usage (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
    endpoint VARCHAR(255),
    request_count INTEGER,
    compute_units INTEGER,
