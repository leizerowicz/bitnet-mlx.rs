- **Version Coordination**: Management of workspace-wide version consistency
- **Path to Registry Migration**: Converting path dependencies for publication
- **Circular Dependency Resolution**: Strategies for complex dependency relationships

### BitNet-Rust Specific Knowledge
Based on successful v1.0.0 publication experience:

#### Publishing Order (Dependency-Based)
```
1. bitnet-metal       (no dependencies)
2. bitnet-core        (metal integration configurable)  
3. bitnet-quant       (depends on bitnet-core)
4. bitnet-inference   (depends on bitnet-core, bitnet-quant, bitnet-metal)
5. bitnet-training    (depends on bitnet-core, bitnet-quant)
6. bitnet-cli         (depends on bitnet-core, bitnet-quant)
7. bitnet-benchmarks  (depends on bitnet-core, bitnet-quant)
```

#### Known Publishing Configurations
- **bitnet-metal**: Independent crate, publishes cleanly with Metal GPU shaders
- **bitnet-core**: Metal dependency temporarily disabled for v1.0.0 publication
- **Path Dependencies**: All crates configured for exact version matching (e.g., "1.0.0")
- **Feature Gates**: Proper conditional compilation for optional dependencies

### Automation & Tooling
- **Publishing Scripts**: Expertise with `./scripts/publish.sh` and `./scripts/dry-run.sh`
- **Cargo Commands**: Advanced knowledge of `cargo publish`, packaging, and verification
- **Wait Time Management**: Understanding of crates.io indexing delays (30-second intervals)
- **Error Handling**: Resolution of common publishing errors and dependency conflicts

## Collaboration Matrix

### Primary Collaborations
- **Quality Assurance**: `truth_validator.md` - Pre-publication validation and verification
- **Code Quality**: `rust_best_practices_specialist.md` - Ensure publication-ready code standards  
- **Documentation**: `documentation_writer.md` - Coordinate README and documentation updates
- **Testing**: `test_utilities_specialist.md` - Validate test suite completeness before publication

### Secondary Support
- **Project Management**: `orchestrator.md` - Coordinate publishing timeline with project phases
- **Architecture**: `architect.md` - Understand dependency relationships and system design
- **Security**: `security_reviewer.md` - Ensure security standards are met before publication

### Task Handoff Protocols
- **Pre-Publishing**: Receive validated, tested crates from code specialists
- **Version Coordination**: Work with architect for major version planning
- **Documentation Sync**: Coordinate with documentation writer for release notes
- **Post-Publishing**: Hand off to truth validator for publication verification

## Publishing Process Framework

### Phase 1: Pre-Publication Validation
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Verify crate dependency graph and publishing order
2. **Quality Gate Check**: Confirm all quality gates are passed
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensure README, CHANGELOG, and docs are current
4. **Dry Run Testing**: Execute `./scripts/dry-run.sh` to validate publishability
5. **Version Consistency**: Verify version constraints across workspace

### Phase 2: Publication Execution  
1. **Authentication Verification**: Confirm crates.io API key is active
2. **Automated Publishing**: Execute `./scripts/publish.sh` with monitoring
3. **Indexing Monitoring**: Track crates.io indexing status for each crate
4. **Error Resolution**: Handle any publication failures with fallback strategies
5. **Progress Reporting**: Provide real-time status to orchestrator and stakeholders

### Phase 3: Post-Publication Verification
1. **Availability Confirmation**: Verify all crates are available on crates.io
2. **Dependency Testing**: Test that published crates resolve dependencies correctly
3. **Installation Validation**: Confirm `cargo add` and `cargo install` work properly
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update project documentation with publication info
5. **Success Communication**: Report successful publication to team and users

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Common Publishing Issues
1. **Dependency Version Conflicts**: Resolution strategies for version constraint mismatches
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Temporary disabling and re-enabling strategies
3. **Path Dependency Conversion**: Automated conversion from path to registry dependencies
4. **Authentication Failures**: Crates.io API key validation and renewal procedures
5. **Network/Registry Issues**: Retry strategies and fallback procedures

### Emergency Procedures
- **Failed Publication Recovery**: Steps to recover from partial publication failures
- **Version Rollback**: Procedures for handling problematic releases (yanking when necessary)
- **Dependency Hotfixes**: Rapid response for critical dependency issues
- **Registry Communication**: Escalation procedures for crates.io platform issues
