    engagement_score = (customer.login_frequency / 30) * 20  
    support_score = max(0, 20 - customer.support_tickets * 2)
    payment_score = 20 if customer.payments_current else 0
    feature_score = (customer.features_used / total_features) * 10
    
    total_score = usage_score + engagement_score + support_score + payment_score + feature_score
    return min(total_score, 100)
