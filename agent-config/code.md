### Development Patterns & Standards

#### Error Handling Integration
All new code must integrate with the comprehensive error handling system:
```rust
use bitnet_core::error::{BitNetError, BitNetResult};
use bitnet_core::error::ErrorContext;

// Always use Result types for fallible operations
pub fn my_function() -> BitNetResult<OutputType> {
    // Implementation with proper error context
    operation().with_context("Operation failed in my_function")?;
    Ok(result)
}
```

#### Memory Management Patterns
Utilize the HybridMemoryPool system for efficient memory management:
```rust
use bitnet_core::memory::{HybridMemoryPool, MemoryError};

// Proper memory pool usage
let pool = HybridMemoryPool::instance();
let buffer = pool.allocate_typed::<f32>(size)?;
// Memory automatically returned to pool on drop
```

#### Testing Requirements
Every new feature must include comprehensive tests:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use bitnet_core::test_utils::TestTimeout;

    #[test]
    fn test_new_feature() {
        TestTimeout::new("test_new_feature", 30).run(|| {
            // Test implementation with proper error handling
            let result = my_function()?;
            assert!(result.is_valid());
            Ok(())
        }).expect("Test should pass");
    }
}
```
