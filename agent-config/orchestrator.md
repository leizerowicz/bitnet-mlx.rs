### Dynamic Task Routing & Agent Selection

#### Intelligent Agent Selection Process
When receiving a task, the orchestrator should follow this decision tree:

1. **Task Analysis**: 
   - Identify primary domain (architecture, code, performance, testing, etc.)
   - Assess complexity level (simple, medium, high, critical)
   - Determine required skills and knowledge areas
   - Identify dependencies and cross-cutting concerns

2. **Primary Agent Selection**:
   - Match task domain to specialist expertise
   - Consider current workload and availability
   - Factor in recent performance and success rate
   - Account for learning curve and domain familiarity

3. **Support Team Assembly**:
   - Identify secondary specialists for cross-domain tasks
   - Include quality assurance (truth_validator.md) for critical tasks
   - Add documentation support for user-facing features
   - Include security review for sensitive components

4. **Coordination Strategy**:
   - Simple tasks: Single specialist with orchestrator oversight
   - Medium tasks: 2-3 specialists with regular sync points
   - Complex tasks: Full team coordination with daily standups
   - Critical tasks: All hands with escalation protocols

#### Task Prioritization Algorithm
```
Priority = (Impact × Urgency × Dependencies) / (Resources Required × Risk Level)

Where:
- Impact: 1-5 (Low to Critical business impact)
- Urgency: 1-5 (Low to Immediate timeline pressure)  
- Dependencies: 1-3 (Standalone to High dependency)
- Resources: 1-5 (Single person to Full team)
- Risk: 1-5 (Low to High risk of failure)
```

#### Agent Workload Balancing
- **Load Distribution**: Monitor and balance specialist workloads
- **Skill Development**: Rotate assignments to build cross-domain expertise
- **Burnout Prevention**: Alternate high-intensity and routine tasks
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Pair experienced with learning specialists

#### Escalation Triggers
- **Technical Blocker**: Issue unresolved after 1 day → Escalate to architect.md
- **Resource Constraint**: Workload exceeds capacity → Redistribute or delay
- **Quality Concern**: Multiple failed attempts → Add truth_validator.md oversight
- **Timeline Risk**: Sprint goals at risk → Full team coordination mode

#### Success Criteria for Agent Selection
- **Task Completion**: Work completed within estimated timeframe
- **Quality Standards**: Meets or exceeds defined quality gates  
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Learning and documentation captured
- **Team Satisfaction**: Positive collaboration and communication
- **Continuous Improvement**: Process refinement based on outcomes

### Agent Hooks System Integration

#### Hook-Enhanced Task Execution Workflow
The orchestrator integrates with the comprehensive **Agent Hooks System** (`agent-hooks.md`) to provide automated lifecycle management, quality assurance, and seamless coordination:

```
Enhanced Task Flow with Hooks:
1. **PRE_TASK_SETUP Hook** → Validate agent capability and prepare workspace
2. **Agent Selection** → Use routing matrix with hook-based validation
3. **PRE_TASK_VALIDATION Hook** → Verify readiness before implementation
4. **Task Execution** → Agent performs primary work with monitoring hooks
5. **COLLABORATION_COORDINATION Hooks** → Inter-agent sync for complex tasks  
6. **POST_TASK_VALIDATION Hook** → Comprehensive quality and integration checks
7. **POST_TASK_CLEANUP Hook** → Resource cleanup and documentation updates
8. **HANDOFF_PREPARATION Hook** → Prepare for next phase or agent transition
```

#### Hook-Based Quality Gates
**Automated Quality Assurance Integration:**
- **CODE_QUALITY_GATE**: Automated code quality validation before handoff
- **INTEGRATION_QUALITY_GATE**: Cross-crate compatibility and performance checks
- **TRUTH_VALIDATION_CHECK**: Evidence-based verification of completion claims
- **COMMERCIAL_READINESS_VALIDATION**: Customer-facing feature validation

#### Hook-Enhanced Agent Coordination
**Inter-Agent Communication Automation:**
- **AGENT_HANDOFF_PREPARE**: Automated context preparation and documentation
- **AGENT_HANDOFF_EXECUTE**: Seamless responsibility transfer with validation
- **COLLABORATION_INIT**: Multi-agent task coordination setup
- **COLLABORATION_SYNC**: Regular automated synchronization and conflict resolution

#### Error Handling and Escalation Hooks
**Automated Issue Detection and Response:**
- **ERROR_DETECTION**: Rapid identification and categorization of issues
- **BLOCKER_ESCALATION**: Automated escalation when resolution time exceeds thresholds
- **RECOVERY_COORDINATION**: Automated coordination of recovery efforts

### Communication & Collaboration

#### Inter-Agent Coordination Protocols (Hook-Enhanced)
- **Task Handoffs**: Clear documentation and context transfer via **AGENT_HANDOFF** hooks
- **Progress Updates**: Regular status reporting with **COLLABORATION_SYNC** hook automation
- **Blocker Resolution**: Immediate escalation via **BLOCKER_ESCALATION** hooks with problem statements
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documentation of solutions via **POST_TASK_CLEANUP** hooks
- **Quality Review**: Cross-specialist validation through **TRUTH_VALIDATION** and **CODE_QUALITY** hooks

#### Daily Coordination Workflow (Hook-Automated)
1. **Morning Sync**: Review priorities with **PRE_TASK_SETUP** hook validation
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Track advancement via **COLLABORATION_SYNC** hooks and quality metrics
3. **Blocker Resolution**: Address impediments through **ERROR_DETECTION** and **BLOCKER_ESCALATION** hooks
4. **Evening Review**: Assess accomplishments via **POST_TASK_VALIDATION** hooks and plan tomorrow
5. **Continuous Adjustment**: Adapt plans via **WORKFLOW_STATE_MANAGEMENT** hooks based on priorities

#### Status Reporting Framework
**Daily Standups (Virtual):**
- Progress on assigned tasks
- Blockers requiring coordination
- Resource needs and dependencies
- Cross-team collaboration requirements

**Weekly Progress Reports:**
- Sprint goal achievement status
- Metrics and KPIs (test pass rate, build success, performance)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Next sprint planning inputs

#### Issue Escalation Process
```
Level 1: Individual Resolution (< 2 hours)
    ↓ (if unresolved)
Level 2: Team Collaboration (< 1 day)
    ↓ (if unresolved)
Level 3: Cross-Team Coordination (< 3 days)
    ↓ (if unresolved)
Level 4: Architecture/Design Review
```

### Risk Management & Mitigation

#### Current Risk Assessment
**High Risks:**
1. **Single Test Failure**: 1 minor global memory pool test failing in bitnet-core
   - Mitigation: Dedicated debug specialist assignment with memory pool investigation
   - Timeline: 1-2 day resolution target

2. **CLI Development**: Essential command-line tools need completion for user adoption
   - Mitigation: Focused CLI development sprint with clear feature requirements
   - Timeline: Week 1 completion target

**Medium Risks:**
1. **Performance Regression**: New features might impact performance
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking and regression testing
   - Timeline: Ongoing monitoring

2. **Documentation Lag**: API changes outpacing documentation updates
   - Mitigation: Documentation-first development approach
   - Timeline: Parallel documentation development

#### Contingency Planning
- **Test Failure Escalation**: If failures persist beyond 1 week, consider architecture review
- **Performance Issues**: Automated rollback if benchmarks show >25% regression
- **Resource Conflicts**: Cross-training plan to ensure knowledge distribution
- **Timeline Delays**: Flexible sprint boundaries with priority re-evaluation

### Success Metrics & KPIs
