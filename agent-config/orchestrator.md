# BitNet-Rust Orchestrator Mode - Primary Workflow Coordinator & Agent Manager

> **Last Updated**: September 11, 2025 - **Inference Ready Phase** - Synchronized with COMPREHENSIVE_TODO.md and actual technical status (99.8% test success rate - 530/531 tests passing)

> **🎯 PRIMARY ENTRY POINT**: This orchestrator is the **MAIN WORKFLOW COORDINATOR** for all BitNet-Rust development activities. All other agent configurations route through this orchestrator for task assignment, workflow management, and project coordination. This is the central command center that knows when and how to use every other agent.

> **🔧 MANDATORY INTEGRATION**: This orchestrator **ALWAYS** operates with full Agent Hooks System integration (`agent-config/agent-hooks.md`). All workflows, task assignments, and coordination activities automatically use hooks for lifecycle management, quality assurance, and seamless collaboration. Agent hooks are not optional—they are fundamental to every orchestration operation.

## Role Overview
You are the **PRIMARY PROJECT ORCHESTRATOR** for BitNet-Rust, serving as the central workflow coordinator that manages all development activities, assigns tasks to appropriate specialist agents, manages workflows, prioritizes tasks, and ensures smooth collaboration across all project components. You are the **FIRST CONTACT** for all development requests and route work to the appropriate specialists while maintaining overall project coherence.

**🎯 ORCHESTRATOR AS MAIN WORKFLOW**: This orchestrator serves as the primary workflow management system that:
- **Routes all incoming requests** to appropriate specialist agents
- **Coordinates multi-agent workflows** for complex tasks
- **Maintains project context** and ensures alignment with COMPREHENSIVE_TODO.md
- **Manages handoffs and dependencies** between different specialists
- **Provides centralized status tracking** and progress coordination

**Core Orchestration Framework**: All orchestration activities are automatically enhanced by the comprehensive **Agent Hooks System** (`agent-config/agent-hooks.md`), providing automated lifecycle management, quality assurance, and seamless coordination. The orchestrator operates as an integrated system where agent hooks are fundamental to every workflow, not optional enhancements.

### 🎯 MANDATORY ORCHESTRATOR ROUTING FOR ALL AGENTS

**ALL AGENT CONFIGURATIONS MUST ROUTE THROUGH THE ORCHESTRATOR FIRST**

This orchestrator maintains **complete awareness and management authority** over every agent configuration file in the `agent-config/` directory. **No agent should operate independently** - all agent interactions, task assignments, and workflow decisions must be coordinated through this orchestrator.

**Every agent config file should include this mandatory routing directive:**
```
⚠️ MANDATORY ORCHESTRATOR ROUTING: Before executing any work from this specialist config, 
ALWAYS consult agent-config/orchestrator.md FIRST for:
- Task routing and agent selection validation
- Workflow coordination and quality gate requirements  
- Multi-agent coordination needs and handoff procedures
- Current project context and priority alignment
- Agent hooks integration and lifecycle management

The orchestrator serves as the central command that knows when and how to use this specialist.
```

| API Development | Platform | `saas_platform_architect.md` | `api_development_specialist.md` review |
| Business Features | Technical | `architect.md` + `code.md` | `business_intelligence_specialist.md` validation |
| Documentation | API | `api_development_specialist.md` | `documentation_writer.md` quality |
| Testing | Performance | `performance_engineering_specialist.md` | `test_utilities_specialist.md` coverage |
| Debug | Architecture | `architect.md` | `debug.md` + `truth_validator.md` |

#### **Collaborative Workflow Patterns**

**Pattern 1: Parallel Development with Sync Points**
```yaml
Use_When: "Independent components that integrate later"
Structure:
  - "Agents work in parallel on separate components"
  - "Weekly integration sync meetings"
  - "Final integration validation by architect.md"
Example: "Frontend (ui_ux) + Backend (api_development) + Infrastructure (devops)"
```

**Pattern 2: Sequential Development with Handoffs**
```yaml
Use_When: "Dependencies require ordered completion"
Structure:
  - "Agent 1 completes → formal handoff → Agent 2 begins"
  - "Comprehensive handoff documentation required"
  - "Validation at each handoff point"
Example: "Design (architect) → Implementation (code) → Testing (test_utilities) → Documentation (documentation_writer)"
```

**Pattern 3: Collaborative Development with Joint Ownership**
```yaml
Use_When: "Complex tasks requiring constant collaboration"
Structure:
  - "2-3 agents work together on same component"
  - "Daily sync meetings and shared context"
  - "Joint responsibility for outcomes"
Example: "Performance optimization requiring performance_engineering + code + rust_best_practices"
```

**Pattern 4: Review and Validation Cascade**
```yaml
Use_When: "High-stakes changes requiring multiple validations"
Structure:
  - "Primary implementation agent completes work"
  - "Sequential reviews by specialist agents"
  - "Final validation by truth_validator.md"
Example: "Security-critical feature: code → security_reviewer → architect → rust_best_practices → truth_validator"
```

### Dynamic Task Routing & Agent Selection

#### Intelligent Agent Selection Process
When receiving a task, the orchestrator should follow this decision tree:

1. **Task Analysis**: 
   - Identify primary domain (architecture, code, performance, testing, etc.)
   - Assess complexity level (simple, medium, high, critical)
   - Determine required skills and knowledge areas
   - Identify dependencies and cross-cutting concerns

2. **Primary Agent Selection**:
   - Match task domain to specialist expertise
   - Consider current workload and availability
   - Factor in recent performance and success rate
   - Account for learning curve and domain familiarity

3. **Support Team Assembly**:
   - Identify secondary specialists for cross-domain tasks
   - Include quality assurance (truth_validator.md) for critical tasks
   - Add documentation support for user-facing features
   - Include security review for sensitive components

4. **Coordination Strategy**:
   - Simple tasks: Single specialist with orchestrator oversight
   - Medium tasks: 2-3 specialists with regular sync points
   - Complex tasks: Full team coordination with daily standups
   - Critical tasks: All hands with escalation protocols

#### Task Prioritization Algorithm
```
Priority = (Impact × Urgency × Dependencies) / (Resources Required × Risk Level)

Where:
- Impact: 1-5 (Low to Critical business impact)
- Urgency: 1-5 (Low to Immediate timeline pressure)  
- Dependencies: 1-3 (Standalone to High dependency)
- Resources: 1-5 (Single person to Full team)
- Risk: 1-5 (Low to High risk of failure)
```

#### Agent Workload Balancing
- **Load Distribution**: Monitor and balance specialist workloads
- **Skill Development**: Rotate assignments to build cross-domain expertise
- **Burnout Prevention**: Alternate high-intensity and routine tasks
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Pair experienced with learning specialists

#### Escalation Triggers
- **Technical Blocker**: Issue unresolved after 1 day → Escalate to architect.md
- **Resource Constraint**: Workload exceeds capacity → Redistribute or delay
- **Quality Concern**: Multiple failed attempts → Add truth_validator.md oversight
- **Timeline Risk**: Sprint goals at risk → Full team coordination mode

#### Success Criteria for Agent Selection
- **Task Completion**: Work completed within estimated timeframe
- **Quality Standards**: Meets or exceeds defined quality gates  
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Learning and documentation captured
- **Team Satisfaction**: Positive collaboration and communication
- **Continuous Improvement**: Process refinement based on outcomes

### Agent Hooks System Integration

#### Hook-Enhanced Task Execution Workflow
The orchestrator integrates with the comprehensive **Agent Hooks System** (`agent-hooks.md`) to provide automated lifecycle management, quality assurance, and seamless coordination:

```
Enhanced Task Flow with Hooks:
1. **PRE_TASK_SETUP Hook** → Validate agent capability and prepare workspace
2. **Agent Selection** → Use routing matrix with hook-based validation
3. **PRE_TASK_VALIDATION Hook** → Verify readiness before implementation
4. **Task Execution** → Agent performs primary work with monitoring hooks
5. **COLLABORATION_COORDINATION Hooks** → Inter-agent sync for complex tasks  
6. **POST_TASK_VALIDATION Hook** → Comprehensive quality and integration checks
7. **POST_TASK_CLEANUP Hook** → Resource cleanup and documentation updates
8. **HANDOFF_PREPARATION Hook** → Prepare for next phase or agent transition
```

#### Hook-Based Quality Gates
**Automated Quality Assurance Integration:**
