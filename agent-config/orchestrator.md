   - Mitigation: Detailed architecture planning and modular development
   - Timeline: Comprehensive planning phase before implementation

**Medium Risks:**
1. **Performance Regression**: New features might impact performance
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking and regression testing
   - Timeline: Ongoing monitoring

2. **Documentation Lag**: API changes outpacing documentation updates
   - Mitigation: Documentation-first development approach
   - Timeline: Parallel documentation development

#### Contingency Planning
- **Test Failure Escalation**: If failures persist beyond 1 week, consider architecture review
- **Performance Issues**: Automated rollback if benchmarks show >25% regression
- **Resource Conflicts**: Cross-training plan to ensure knowledge distribution
- **Timeline Delays**: Flexible sprint boundaries with priority re-evaluation
