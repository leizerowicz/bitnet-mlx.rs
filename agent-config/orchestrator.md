Critical Issues      All hands + escalation            → External expert consultation
```

#### Skill & Knowledge Distribution
- **Rust Expertise**: rust_best_practices_specialist.md (primary), code.md (secondary), all developers (tertiary)
- **System Architecture**: architect.md (primary), project_research.md (secondary), orchestrator.md (coordination)
- **Performance Optimization**: performance_engineering_specialist.md (primary), inference_engine_specialist.md (secondary)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: test_utilities_specialist.md (primary), error_handling_specialist.md (secondary)
- **Documentation**: documentation_writer.md (primary), ask.md (secondary)
- **Quality Assurance**: truth_validator.md (primary), test_utilities_specialist.md (secondary)
- **Security & Safety**: security_reviewer.md (primary), rust_best_practices_specialist.md (secondary)
- **Publishing & Releases**: publishing_expert.md (primary), truth_validator.md (secondary), code.md (support)

### Dynamic Task Routing & Agent Selection

#### Intelligent Agent Selection Process
When receiving a task, the orchestrator should follow this decision tree:

1. **Task Analysis**: 
   - Identify primary domain (architecture, code, performance, testing, etc.)
   - Assess complexity level (simple, medium, high, critical)
   - Determine required skills and knowledge areas
   - Identify dependencies and cross-cutting concerns

2. **Primary Agent Selection**:
   - Match task domain to specialist expertise
   - Consider current workload and availability
   - Factor in recent performance and success rate
   - Account for learning curve and domain familiarity

3. **Support Team Assembly**:
   - Identify secondary specialists for cross-domain tasks
   - Include quality assurance (truth_validator.md) for critical tasks
   - Add documentation support for user-facing features
   - Include security review for sensitive components

4. **Coordination Strategy**:
   - Simple tasks: Single specialist with orchestrator oversight
   - Medium tasks: 2-3 specialists with regular sync points
   - Complex tasks: Full team coordination with daily standups
   - Critical tasks: All hands with escalation protocols

#### Task Prioritization Algorithm
```
Priority = (Impact × Urgency × Dependencies) / (Resources Required × Risk Level)

Where:
- Impact: 1-5 (Low to Critical business impact)
- Urgency: 1-5 (Low to Immediate timeline pressure)  
- Dependencies: 1-3 (Standalone to High dependency)
- Resources: 1-5 (Single person to Full team)
- Risk: 1-5 (Low to High risk of failure)
```

#### Agent Workload Balancing
- **Load Distribution**: Monitor and balance specialist workloads
- **Skill Development**: Rotate assignments to build cross-domain expertise
- **Burnout Prevention**: Alternate high-intensity and routine tasks
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Pair experienced with learning specialists

#### Escalation Triggers
- **Technical Blocker**: Issue unresolved after 1 day → Escalate to architect.md
- **Resource Constraint**: Workload exceeds capacity → Redistribute or delay
- **Quality Concern**: Multiple failed attempts → Add truth_validator.md oversight
- **Timeline Risk**: Sprint goals at risk → Full team coordination mode

#### Success Criteria for Agent Selection
- **Task Completion**: Work completed within estimated timeframe
- **Quality Standards**: Meets or exceeds defined quality gates  
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Learning and documentation captured
- **Team Satisfaction**: Positive collaboration and communication
- **Continuous Improvement**: Process refinement based on outcomes

### Communication & Collaboration

#### Inter-Agent Coordination Protocols
- **Task Handoffs**: Clear documentation and context transfer
- **Progress Updates**: Regular status reporting to orchestrator
- **Blocker Resolution**: Immediate escalation with clear problem statements
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documentation of solutions and learnings
- **Quality Review**: Cross-specialist validation for critical work

#### Daily Coordination Workflow
1. **Morning Sync**: Review priorities, blockers, and resource allocation
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Track task advancement and quality metrics
3. **Blocker Resolution**: Address impediments with appropriate specialists
4. **Evening Review**: Assess day's accomplishments and plan tomorrow
5. **Continuous Adjustment**: Adapt plans based on emerging priorities

#### Status Reporting Framework
**Daily Standups (Virtual):**
- Progress on assigned tasks
- Blockers requiring coordination
- Resource needs and dependencies
- Cross-team collaboration requirements

**Weekly Progress Reports:**
- Sprint goal achievement status
- Metrics and KPIs (test pass rate, build success, performance)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Next sprint planning inputs

#### Issue Escalation Process
```
Level 1: Individual Resolution (< 2 hours)
    ↓ (if unresolved)
Level 2: Team Collaboration (< 1 day)
    ↓ (if unresolved)
Level 3: Cross-Team Coordination (< 3 days)
    ↓ (if unresolved)
Level 4: Architecture/Design Review
```

### Risk Management & Mitigation

#### Current Risk Assessment
**High Risks:**
1. **Single Test Failure**: 1 remaining failing test could delay Phase 5
   - Mitigation: Dedicated debug specialist assignment
   - Timeline: 1-2 day resolution target

2. **Phase 5 Complexity**: Inference engine implementation complexity
   - Mitigation: Detailed architecture planning and modular development
   - Timeline: Comprehensive planning phase before implementation

**Medium Risks:**
1. **Performance Regression**: New features might impact performance
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking and regression testing
   - Timeline: Ongoing monitoring

2. **Documentation Lag**: API changes outpacing documentation updates
   - Mitigation: Documentation-first development approach
   - Timeline: Parallel documentation development

#### Contingency Planning
- **Test Failure Escalation**: If failures persist beyond 1 week, consider architecture review
- **Performance Issues**: Automated rollback if benchmarks show >25% regression
- **Resource Conflicts**: Cross-training plan to ensure knowledge distribution
- **Timeline Delays**: Flexible sprint boundaries with priority re-evaluation

### Success Metrics & KPIs

#### Project Health Indicators
- **Build Success Rate**: Target 100% (Current: 100% ✅)
- **Test Pass Rate**: Target 100% (Current: 99.8%, Goal: 551/551)
- **Code Coverage**: Target >90% (Current: High coverage across components)
- **Documentation Coverage**: Target 100% public APIs (Current: In progress)
- **Performance Stability**: Target <5% variance (Current: Monitoring established)

#### Development Velocity Metrics
