   - Mitigation: Documentation-first development approach
   - Timeline: Parallel documentation development

#### Contingency Planning
- **Test Failure Escalation**: If failures persist beyond 1 week, consider architecture review
- **Performance Issues**: Automated rollback if benchmarks show >25% regression
- **Resource Conflicts**: Cross-training plan to ensure knowledge distribution
- **Timeline Delays**: Flexible sprint boundaries with priority re-evaluation
