## Automated Story Completion Protocol - Quick Reference

**For Future Story Completions**: When any story completion report is available, trigger the `PRODUCTION_OPERATIONS_STORY_COMPLETION_AUTOMATION` hook or equivalent specialized completion hook following this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze Completion Report
- Extract completion status, deliverables, line counts, acceptance criteria results
- Identify technical achievements, business value, and customer impact
- Validate SPARC documentation completeness and quality validation results

### Step 2: Execute Automated Updates
1. **Update BACKLOG.md**: Convert tasks to completed status with timestamps and deliverable details
2. **Sync Orchestrator.md**: Update current status and priority matrix with new capabilities  
3. **Refresh Development Phase Tracker**: Update test status, capabilities, and milestone progress
4. **Cascade Agent Config Updates**: Update all relevant specialist configurations with new capabilities
5. **Document Business Impact**: Record customer value delivery and commercial readiness improvements

### Step 3: Quality Validation and Communication
- Verify all acceptance criteria documented with evidence
- Validate cross-file consistency and accuracy
- Generate stakeholder notifications and impact reports
- Update commercial readiness metrics and customer onboarding capabilities

**Reference Implementation**: Story 2.2 Production Operations completion (September 2, 2025) - See automation example above for detailed execution pattern.

This automated workflow ensures comprehensive project documentation maintenance and stakeholder communication for all future story completions in the BitNet-Rust commercial readiness phase.
