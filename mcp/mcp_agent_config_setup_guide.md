## Project Overview

MCP Swarm Intelligence Server is a high-performance implementation of collective intelligence for multi-agent coordination, featuring agent ecosystem management, hive mind knowledge bases, and automated workflow orchestration. The project follows the **Orchestrator-Driven Multi-Agent Workflow**.

## Agent Configuration System - Orchestrator-Driven Multi-Agent Workflow

This project uses the EXACT SAME agent configuration system as BitNet-Rust. **THE ORCHESTRATOR IS THE CENTRAL COMMAND** that routes all work and manages all specialist coordination.

### üéØ MANDATORY ORCHESTRATOR-FIRST WORKFLOW

**ALWAYS START WITH THE ORCHESTRATOR** - This is non-negotiable for any development work:
