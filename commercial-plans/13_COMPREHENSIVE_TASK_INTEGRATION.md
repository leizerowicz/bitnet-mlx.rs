## ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT & CONTINGENCIES (From FINAL_TASK_DELEGATION_REPORT)

### Task Risk Assessment
**High-Confidence Tasks (Low Risk)**:
- Final test resolution (Tasks 1.1 & 1.2): Very Low risk - minor adjustments with proven fix patterns
- Documentation alignment: Low risk - synchronization only, no new development

**Medium-Confidence Tasks (Medium Risk)**:
- Performance optimization and API refinement (Tasks 2.1-2.3): Low-Medium risk - infrastructure complete
- Advanced GPU features: Medium risk - requires optimization but foundation solid

**Strategic Tasks (Higher Risk, Lower Priority)**:
- Research integration and commercial enhancement (Tasks 3.1-3.3): Medium risk - exploratory nature

### Contingency Plans
1. **If critical tasks encounter unexpected issues**: Escalate to `architect.md` for design review
2. **If performance targets prove unachievable**: Adjust targets based on realistic benchmarking
3. **If resource constraints emerge**: Re-prioritize based on business value and customer impact

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (48 Hours)
1. **`test_utilities_specialist.md`**: Begin final test resolution (9 quantization thresholds, 3 dtype fixes)
2. **`documentation_writer.md`**: Start agent-config synchronization across 18 files
3. **`truth_validator.md`**: Validate 97.7%-99.8% test success claims across all reports
4. **`code.md`**: Begin HuggingFace model downloading implementation for CLI commands
5. **`api_development_specialist.md`**: Design HuggingFace Hub integration architecture and authentication
6. **`orchestrator.md`**: Implement daily coordination protocol (15-min morning, 10-min evening)

## 🎯 WEEK 1 PRIORITY FEATURES (Critical for Customer Adoption)
1. **HuggingFace Model Downloading**: `bitnet model download <model-id>` command with authentication
2. **Model Caching System**: Local model cache with version management
3. **Model Format Detection**: Automatic format detection and conversion pipeline
4. **Interactive Setup**: Hardware detection with HuggingFace authentication setup
5. **Performance Benchmarking**: Basic benchmarking with downloaded models

This comprehensive integration ensures no existing commercial plans are lost while properly incorporating all technical requirements and maintaining clear delegation based on the orchestrator configuration. The addition of HuggingFace model downloading capabilities will significantly improve customer onboarding experience and reduce friction in the adoption process.
