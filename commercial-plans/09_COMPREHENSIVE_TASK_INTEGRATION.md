## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MANAGEMENT & CONTINGENCIES (From FINAL_TASK_DELEGATION_REPORT)

### Task Risk Assessment
**High-Confidence Tasks (Low Risk)**:
- Final test resolution (Tasks 1.1 & 1.2): Very Low risk - minor adjustments with proven fix patterns
- Documentation alignment: Low risk - synchronization only, no new development

**Medium-Confidence Tasks (Medium Risk)**:
- Performance optimization and API refinement (Tasks 2.1-2.3): Low-Medium risk - infrastructure complete
- Advanced GPU features: Medium risk - requires optimization but foundation solid

**Strategic Tasks (Higher Risk, Lower Priority)**:
- Research integration and commercial enhancement (Tasks 3.1-3.3): Medium risk - exploratory nature

### Contingency Plans
1. **If critical tasks encounter unexpected issues**: Escalate to `architect.md` for design review
2. **If performance targets prove unachievable**: Adjust targets based on realistic benchmarking
3. **If resource constraints emerge**: Re-prioritize based on business value and customer impact

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (48 Hours)
1. **`test_utilities_specialist.md`**: Begin final test resolution (9 quantization thresholds, 3 dtype fixes)
2. **`documentation_writer.md`**: Start agent-config synchronization across 18 files
3. **`truth_validator.md`**: Validate 97.7%-99.8% test success claims across all reports
4. **`orchestrator.md`**: Implement daily coordination protocol (15-min morning, 10-min evening)

This comprehensive integration ensures no existing commercial plans are lost while properly incorporating all technical requirements and maintaining clear delegation based on the orchestrator configuration.
