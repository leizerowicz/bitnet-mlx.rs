let weights = BitNetTensor::randn(&[256, 512], BitNetDType::F32, &device, &pool)?;
let quantized = absmean_quantize_weights(&weights, &device)?;

println!("Memory reduction: {:.1}x", quantized.compression_ratio());
println!("Device: {:?}", device);
```

### MLX Acceleration (Apple Silicon Optimization)

use bitnet_core::mlx::*;

// Enterprise-grade MLX integration with error handling
if is_mlx_available() {
    let device = default_mlx_device()?;
    let input = MlxTensor::ones(&[1024, 512], BitNetDType::F32, device.clone())?;
    
    // High-performance acceleration with production monitoring
    let output = BitNetMlxOps::bitlinear_forward(&input, &weights, None, false)?;
