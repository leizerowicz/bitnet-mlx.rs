**Project Phase**: Technical Foundation Development - Test Stabilization Required  
**Priority Framework**: Technical Stability √ó Test Coverage √ó Commercial Viability

---

## üéØ Current Project Context

**BitNet-Rust Status**: Neural network quantization platform in active development. All 7 core crates compile successfully with comprehensive error handling (2,300+ lines) and cross-platform support in development. **Epic 1 IN PROGRESS**: Task 1.1.1 functionally complete (tensor arithmetic operations stable), now focusing on memory management stabilization (Task 1.1.2). **Epic 2 PARTIAL**: BitNet-CLI basic functionality operational (30/30 CLI tests passing) but dependent on core stability.

**Current Priority**: **COMPLETE** - Task 1.1.1.1: Fixed test isolation issues introduced by Task 1.1.1 memory pool changes. Sequential test execution now reliable (100% pass rate), parallel execution improved but requires `--test-threads=1` for full reliability due to global memory pool architecture limitations.
