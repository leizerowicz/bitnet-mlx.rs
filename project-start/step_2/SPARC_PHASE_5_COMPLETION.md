## User Documentation

### Getting Started Guide: **30-Minute Customer Onboarding**

#### Quick Start Tutorial

```markdown
# BitNet-Rust Quick Start: Production Model Quantization in 30 Minutes

Welcome to BitNet-Rust! This guide will take you from account creation to your first production-ready quantized model in under 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ML model in supported format (SafeTensors, ONNX, PyTorch)
- Basic understanding of neural network deployment

## Step 1: Account Creation (3 minutes)

### Create Your BitNet-Rust Account
1. Visit [https://platform.bitnet.dev/signup](https://platform.bitnet.dev/signup)
2. Choose your tier:
   - **Developer** ($99/month): Perfect for experimentation and small models
   - **Team** ($499/month): Ideal for startups and growing teams
   - **Business** ($2,999/month): Enterprise-grade with dedicated resources

3. Complete registration with email verification
4. Set up two-factor authentication (recommended for security)

### Verify Your Environment
```bash
# Install BitNet-Rust CLI
curl -sSL https://install.bitnet.dev | bash
bitnet --version  # Should show v1.0.0 or later

# Verify API connectivity
bitnet auth login
bitnet health check
```

## Step 2: Upload and Quantize Your First Model (10 minutes)

### Using the Web Dashboard
1. Navigate to [Models](https://platform.bitnet.dev/models)
2. Click "Upload New Model"
3. Choose your model file (up to 10GB for Team tier)
4. Configure quantization settings:
   ```yaml
   Quantization Scheme: BitNet 1.58-bit (recommended)
   Optimization Level: Balanced (speed + accuracy)
   Target Device: Auto-detect (optimal performance)
   Quality Threshold: 95% accuracy retention
   ```

5. Click "Start Quantization" and monitor progress

### Using the CLI (Advanced)
```bash
# Upload and quantize model with CLI
bitnet models upload \
  --file ./my-model.safetensors \
  --name "production-llm-7b" \
  --config quantization-config.yaml

# Monitor quantization progress
bitnet models status production-llm-7b

# Download quantized model when complete
bitnet models download production-llm-7b --output ./quantized-model.bitnet
```

## Step 3: Deploy and Test Inference (10 minutes)

### Quick Inference Test
```python
import requests
import json

# Set up API authentication
api_key = "your-api-key-here"  # From dashboard
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}

# Submit inference request
inference_request = {
    "model_id": "production-llm-7b",
    "inputs": [
        {"input_tensor": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]},  # Your input data
    ],
    "batch_optimization": "auto"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.bitnet.dev/v1/inference/batch",
    headers=headers,
    json=inference_request
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Inference completed in {result['performance_metrics']['total_latency']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['results'][0]['confidence']:.2%}")
```

### Production Integration Example
```javascript
// Node.js example with BitNet-Rust SDK
const BitNetClient = require('@bitnet/client');

const client = new BitNetClient({
  apiKey: process.env.BITNET_API_KEY,
  tier: 'team'
});

async function processUserRequest(inputData) {
  try {
    const result = await client.inference.batch({
      modelId: 'production-llm-7b',
      inputs: [inputData],
      priority: 'high'
    });
    
    return {
      prediction: result.outputs[0],
      confidence: result.confidence,
      latency: result.latency,
      cost: result.billing.estimatedCost
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Inference failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Monitor Performance and Costs (5 minutes)

### View Usage Dashboard
1. Navigate to [Analytics](https://platform.bitnet.dev/analytics)
2. Review key metrics:
   - **API Calls**: Current usage vs monthly quota
   - **Latency**: p95 response times trending
   - **Costs**: Real-time cost breakdown and projections
   - **Model Performance**: Accuracy and throughput metrics

### Set Up Alerts
```bash
# Configure usage alerts
bitnet alerts create \
  --name "Monthly Quota Warning" \
  --trigger "usage.api_calls > 80%" \
  --action "email"

bitnet alerts create \
  --name "High Latency Alert" \
  --trigger "latency.p95 > 200ms" \
  --action "slack,email"
```

## Step 5: Scale to Production (2 minutes)

### Enable Auto-Scaling
```yaml
# production-config.yaml
auto_scaling:
  enabled: true
  min_instances: 2
  max_instances: 20
  scale_up_threshold: "cpu > 70% for 2 minutes"
  scale_down_threshold: "cpu < 30% for 5 minutes"

monitoring:
  health_check_interval: "30 seconds"
  alerting:
    - type: "latency"
      threshold: "p95 > 100ms"
      action: "scale_up"
    - type: "error_rate"
      threshold: "> 1%"
      action: "alert_oncall"
```

### FAQ: **Common Questions & Solutions**

```markdown
# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

**Q: How long does model quantization take?**
A: Quantization time depends on model size:
- Small models (<1GB): 2-5 minutes
- Medium models (1-10GB): 5-15 minutes  
- Large models (10-100GB): 15-60 minutes

**Q: What model formats are supported?**
A: BitNet-Rust supports:
- SafeTensors (.safetensors) - Recommended
- ONNX (.onnx) - Full support
- PyTorch (.pth, .pt) - Full support
- TensorFlow SavedModel - Convert to ONNX first
- Hugging Face models - Direct integration available

**Q: Can I quantize models larger than 100GB?**
A: Yes, Enterprise customers can quantize models up to 1TB. Contact support for custom configurations.

## Performance & Optimization

**Q: Why is my inference slower than expected?**
A: Common causes and solutions:
1. **Batch size too small**: Increase batch size for better GPU utilization
2. **Cold start**: First request includes model loading time (~2-3s)
3. **Network latency**: Consider using regional endpoints
4. **Tier limitations**: Upgrade tier for dedicated resources

**Q: How can I improve quantization accuracy?**
A: Try these optimization strategies:
1. **Mixed precision**: Enable for critical layers
2. **Calibration data**: Provide representative samples
3. **Quality threshold**: Adjust threshold in quantization config
4. **Custom thresholds**: Per-layer optimization for specific models

## Billing & Usage

**Q: How is usage calculated and billed?**
A: Usage is metered based on:
- **API calls**: Per request pricing
- **Compute time**: Actual processing time
- **Storage**: Model and data storage
- **Bandwidth**: Data transfer costs

Billing is calculated hourly and invoiced monthly.

**Q: Can I set usage limits to control costs?**
A: Yes, configure alerts and hard limits:
