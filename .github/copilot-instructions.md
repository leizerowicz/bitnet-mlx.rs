# BitNet-Rust Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

BitNet-Rust is a high-performance implementation of BitNet neural networks featuring 1.58-bit quantization, memory management, GPU acceleration, and testing infrastructure. The project is currently in the **Inference Ready Phase** with 99.8% test success rate, following the COMPREHENSIVE_TODO.md roadmap.

## Agent Configuration System - Orchestrator-Driven Multi-Agent Workflow

This project uses a comprehensive agent configuration system in the `agent-config/` directory to coordinate all development activities. **THE ORCHESTRATOR IS THE CENTRAL COMMAND** that routes all work and manages all specialist coordination.

### ðŸŽ¯ MANDATORY ORCHESTRATOR-FIRST WORKFLOW

**ALWAYS START WITH THE ORCHESTRATOR** - This is non-negotiable for any development work:

#### **Step 1: ORCHESTRATOR CONSULTATION (REQUIRED)**
Before doing ANY work, **ALWAYS read `agent-config/orchestrator.md` FIRST** to:
- **Understand current project context** and priorities (COMPREHENSIVE_TODO.md alignment)
- **Get proper task routing** to appropriate specialist agents
- **Identify multi-agent coordination needs** for complex tasks
- **Access workflow management** and quality gate requirements
- **Integrate with agent hooks system** for automated lifecycle management

#### **Step 2: ORCHESTRATOR ROUTING DECISION**
The orchestrator will route you to appropriate specialists using this framework:
- **Primary Agent Selection**: Based on task domain and complexity
- **Secondary Agent Coordination**: For cross-domain or complex requirements
- **Quality Gate Assignment**: Validation and review requirements
- **Workflow Coordination**: Timeline and dependency management

#### **Step 3: SPECIALIST CONSULTATION (ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDED)**
After orchestrator routing, consult the specific specialist agents identified:
- **Read specialist agent configs** for domain-specific context and expertise
- **Understand agent intersections** and collaboration patterns
- **Follow established workflows** and handoff procedures
- **Maintain orchestrator coordination** throughout the work

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns (Orchestrator-Managed)

The orchestrator manages several coordination patterns for different task types:

#### **Single-Agent Tasks (Orchestrator Oversight)**
```
Simple tasks â†’ Primary specialist + orchestrator coordination
Quality validation â†’ truth_validator.md review
Documentation â†’ documentation_writer.md if user-facing
```

#### **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Orchestrator Coordination)**
```
Complex features â†’ Primary + Secondary specialists + orchestrator management
Cross-domain tasks â†’ Multiple specialists + daily sync + orchestrator coordination
Critical changes â†’ Full review chain + architect + security + orchestrator validation
```

#### **Emergency Response (Orchestrator Escalation)**
```
Critical bugs â†’ debug.md + immediate escalation + orchestrator resource coordination
Performance issues â†’ debug.md + performance_engineering + orchestrator timeline management
Security incidents â†’ security_reviewer + architect + orchestrator incident management
```

### Workflow Decision Framework (Orchestrator-Defined)

**The orchestrator uses this decision matrix for task routing:**

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Secondary Agents | Quality Gates |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Feature Development | `code.md` | `rust_best_practices_specialist.md`, `test_utilities_specialist.md` | Code quality + test coverage |
| Debugging | `debug.md` | `code.md`, `error_handling_specialist.md` | Root cause + fix validation |
| Architecture | `architect.md` | `project_research.md`, `security_reviewer.md` | Design review + security validation |
| Performance | `performance_engineering_specialist.md` | `inference_engine_specialist.md`, `code.md` | Benchmark validation + optimization review |
| Inference Features | `inference_engine_specialist.md` | `api_development_specialist.md`, `performance_engineering_specialist.md` | ML accuracy + API usability |
| Documentation | `documentation_writer.md` | `ask.md`, domain specialists | User testing + accuracy validation |
| Testing | `test_utilities_specialist.md` | `error_handling_specialist.md`, `debug.md` | Coverage + edge case validation |
| Security | `security_reviewer.md` | `rust_best_practices_specialist.md`, `architect.md` | Vulnerability assessment + safe patterns |
| Release | `publishing_expert.md` | `truth_validator.md`, `documentation_writer.md` | Comprehensive validation + documentation |

### Agent Intersection Understanding (Orchestrator-Defined)

**Every agent understands their intersections with other agents:**

- **Code Development** intersects with Rust Best Practices (quality), Debug (fixes), Test Utilities (validation)
- **Debug** intersects with Code (implementation), Error Handling (resilience), Test Utilities (reproduction)
- **Inference Engine** intersects with Performance Engineering (optimization), API Development (interfaces), Code (implementation)
- **Performance Engineering** intersects with Inference Engine (inference speed), Rust Best Practices (efficiency), Architect (system design)
- **Security Reviewer** intersects with Rust Best Practices (safety), Architect (security design), Error Handling (resilience)

**And many more intersections explicitly defined in each agent config.**
