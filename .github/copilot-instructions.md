# BitNet-Rust Copilot Instructions

> **Last Updated**: September 1, 2025 - Synchronized with Agent Configuration System and SPARC Methodology

## Project Overview

BitNet-Rust is a high-performance implementation of BitNet neural networks featuring revolutionary 1.58-bit quantization, advanced memory management, comprehensive GPU acceleration, and production-ready testing infrastructure. This document consolidates all essential information from the project's comprehensive agent configuration system and establishes the workflow for using SPARC methodology with agent configurations to complete project backlogs.

## Agent Configuration Workflow & SPARC Integration

### Primary Workflow: Orchestrator â†’ Agent Selection â†’ SPARC Implementation

**Step 1: Start with Orchestrator**
Always begin task planning by consulting the `orchestrator.md` file in the `agent-config/` folder. The orchestrator provides:
- Current project phase and priorities
- Task routing matrix for selecting appropriate specialist agents
- Coordination protocols and quality gates
- Commercial readiness status and sprint objectives

**Step 2: Agent Selection from Configuration**
Based on the task type, select appropriate agent configurations from the available specialists:

```
Task Categories â†’ Primary Agents â†’ Supporting Agents
--------------------------------------------------
Architecture & Design â†’ architect.md â†’ project_research.md
Code Implementation â†’ code.md â†’ rust_best_practices_specialist.md  
Bug Fixes & Debugging â†’ debug.md â†’ code.md
Performance Work â†’ performance_engineering_specialist.md â†’ inference_engine_specialist.md
Inference Features â†’ inference_engine_specialist.md â†’ performance_engineering_specialist.md
Error Management â†’ error_handling_specialist.md â†’ test_utilities_specialist.md
Testing Work â†’ test_utilities_specialist.md â†’ error_handling_specialist.md
Documentation â†’ documentation_writer.md â†’ ask.md
Security Review â†’ security_reviewer.md â†’ rust_best_practices_specialist.md
Quality Assurance â†’ truth_validator.md â†’ test_utilities_specialist.md
User Interaction â†’ ask.md â†’ documentation_writer.md
Project Management â†’ development_phase_tracker.md â†’ orchestrator.md
```

**Step 3: SPARC Methodology Implementation**
When implementing features or completing backlog items, follow the 5-phase SPARC methodology:

1. **S - Specification**: Define requirements, constraints, and success criteria
2. **P - Pseudocode**: Design algorithms and system logic
3. **A - Architecture**: Plan component structure and interactions
4. **R - Refinement**: Optimize and iterate the implementation
5. **C - Completion**: Final implementation with comprehensive testing

**Step 4: Backlog Integration**
All work items come from the comprehensive backlog (`project-start/step_1/BACKLOG.md`) which provides:
- Priority-based task organization (P0-P3)
- Epic â†’ Story â†’ Task breakdown structure
- Commercial impact and technical feasibility scoring
- Timeline and dependency tracking

### Context Documents Integration

When working on any task, you have access to these context documents that should be referenced:
