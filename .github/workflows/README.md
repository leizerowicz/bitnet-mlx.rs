# Workflows Temporarily Disabled

**Date**: September 2, 2025  
**Reason**: Copilot credit optimization during Commercial Readiness Phase Week 1

## Status
All GitHub Actions workflows have been temporarily moved to `.github/workflows-disabled/` to:
- Conserve Copilot credits during active development
- Focus resources on commercial platform development
- Reduce unnecessary CI overhead during final technical polish phase

## Workflows Disabled
- `ci.yml` - Comprehensive CI testing across multiple OS/Rust versions
- `docs.yml` - Documentation building and deployment
- `release.yml` - Automated release and binary building

## Re-enabling Workflows
When ready to re-enable (likely during commercial deployment phase):
```bash
mv .github/workflows-disabled/* .github/workflows/
rm .github/workflows/README.md
```

## Current Development Approach
During Commercial Readiness Phase Week 1, use local testing:
```bash
# Local testing commands
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo build --release --workspace
```

## Commercial Phase Priorities
1. Final test resolution (18 remaining test failures)
2. CLI development completion
3. SaaS platform MVP development
4. Customer acquisition initiatives

Workflows will be re-enabled when transitioning to production deployment phase with multiple contributors and customer-facing releases.
