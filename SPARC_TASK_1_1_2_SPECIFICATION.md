## Task Context and Current State

### Current Memory Management Architecture
```rust
// Current HybridMemoryPool structure (bitnet-core/src/memory/mod.rs)
pub struct HybridMemoryPool {
    small_block_pool: SmallBlockPool,
    large_block_pool: LargeBlockPool,
    device_pools: HashMap<DeviceKey, DeviceMemoryPool>,
    metrics: Arc<RwLock<MemoryMetrics>>,
    tracking: Option<Arc<MemoryTracker>>,
    cleanup_manager: Option<Arc<CleanupManager>>,
}
```

### Identified Memory Management Issues

#### 1. Memory Tracking Overhead (Critical)
- **Current Failure**: `test_tracking_memory_usage` - 24.60% overhead vs 10% threshold
- **Root Cause**: Excessive tracking metadata causing memory bloat
- **Impact**: Production performance degradation and memory exhaustion
- **Location**: `bitnet-core/tests/memory_tracking_tests.rs:492`

#### 2. Memory Cleanup System Failures (Critical)
- **Current Failures**: 8 tests in `tensor_memory_tests.rs` showing memory not being reclaimed
- **Examples**:
  - `test_tensor_automatic_cleanup_on_drop`: Expected 0 allocations, got 1
  - `test_memory_pool_fragmentation_with_tensors`: Expected 30 reclaimed, got 60
  - `test_tensor_cleanup_with_memory_pressure`: Expected 0 allocations, got 50
- **Root Cause**: Memory cleanup not triggering automatically on tensor drop
- **Impact**: Memory leaks and resource exhaustion over time

#### 3. Memory Pool Fragmentation Issues (High)
- **Current Failure**: Memory not being properly consolidated after deallocation
- **Impact**: Inefficient memory utilization and potential allocation failures
- **Location**: Multiple fragmentation and pressure-related test failures

#### 4. Memory Leak Detection System (Critical)
- **Current Failure**: `test_tensor_memory_leak_detection` - Expected 0 leaks, detected 20
- **Impact**: Production memory leaks compromising long-term stability

### Success Criteria Definition

#### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Memory Tracking Overhead**: Reduce to <10% (currently 24.6%)
2. **Memory Cleanup Reliability**: 100% automatic cleanup on tensor drop
3. **Memory Leak Detection**: Zero memory leaks detected in all test scenarios
4. **Memory Pool Efficiency**: Proper fragmentation handling and memory reclamation
5. **Test Success Rate**: All 30+ memory management tests passing consistently

#### Performance Requirements
- **Memory Overhead**: <10% tracking overhead for production viability
- **Cleanup Timing**: Automatic cleanup within milliseconds of tensor drop
